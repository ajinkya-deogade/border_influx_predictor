Excluded from this dataset are area codes considered to be non-geographic NPAs (area codes designating a specific service rather than a specific geographic area), such as toll-free area codes which encompass the entire NANP area. These area codes are in a separate dataset called HSIP Toll Free Area Codes 2007 Q4 due to the magnitude of the shapes' sizes, which when included in this dataset excessively retards the refresh rate making the dataset a cumbersome tool to use during the processing of other datasets."," imagery, infrastructure, location, map,Geospatial","Under Secretary / Management","024:10","024:003","Open Data (MGMT)","edmo@hq.dhs.gov","2515","public","United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Marianas","-","https://hifld-dhs-gii.opendata.arcgis.com/","05/19/2016","http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/"
"Automatic Traffic Recorder (ATR) Stations","The data included in the GIS Traffic Stations Version database have been assimilated from station description files provided by FHWA for Weigh-in-Motion (WIM), and Automatic Traffic Counters (ATR). Location referencing information was derived from the National Highway Planning Network version 4.0. and State offices of Transportation The attributes on the point elements of the database have come from two primary sources, the Station Description Records and the National Highway Planning Network's Linear Referencing System. The attributes for these databases have been intentionally limited to location referencing attributes since the core station description attribute data are contained within the Station Description Tables (SDT). There is a separate Station Description Table (SDT) for each of the different station types; WIM, and ATR. The attributes in the Station Description Table correspond with the Station Description Record found in Chapter 6 of the latest Traffic Monitoring Guide. The SDT contains the most recent stations available for each state and station type. This table was derived from files provided UTCTR by FHWA. The Station Description Table can be linked to the station shapefile via the STNNKEY field . A single exception table containing records for those stations that could not be located is provided for WIM, and ATR stations. Generally, this table contains records where location descriptions were not clear enough to locate a station.

"Base Flood Elevation (BFE) Lines","The Base Flood Elevation (BFE) table is required for any digital data where BFE lines will be shown on the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). Normally if there are any riverine AE zones, BFE lines are required. The S_BFE table contains information about the BFEs within a study area. A spatial file with locational information also corresponds with this data table. BFE lines indicate the rounded whole-foot water surface elevation of the 1-percent-annual-chance flood. The spatial elements representing BFE features are lines extending from Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) boundary to SFHA boundary. The BFE lines will have no visible gaps or overshoots between the SFHA boundary and the end of the BFE line at the publication scale of the DFIRM. However, the ends of the BFE lines are not necessarily snapped precisely to the SFHA boundary. Each BFE is represented by a single line. While BFE lines are depicted as wavy lines on the hardcopy FIRM, they should be primarily straight lines in the spatial data, although they may bend consistent with procedures described in Volume 1 of these Guidelines. This is a Standard DFIRM Database table. More information can be found in the document ""Guidelines and Specifications for Flood Hazard Mapping Partners Appendix LGuidance for Preparing Draft Digital Data and DFIRM Database"" located on this disk."," imagery, infrastructure, location, map,Geospatial","Under Secretary / Management","024:10","024:003","Open Data (MGMT)","edmo@hq.dhs.gov","2517","public","Continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Marianas","-","https://hifld-dhs-gii.opendata.arcgis.com/","05/19/2016","http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/"

"Broadband Radio Service (BRS) and Educational Broadband Service (EBS) Transmitters","The Broadband Radio Service (BRS), formerly known as the Multipoint Distribution Service (MDS)/Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS), is a commercial service. In the past, it was generally used for the transmission of data and video programming to subscribers using high-powered systems, also known as wireless cable. However, over the years, the uses have evolved to include digital two-way systems capable of providing high-speed, high-capacity broadband service, including two-way Internet service via cellularized communication systems. Such services provide consumers integrated access to voice, high-speed data, video-on-demand, and interactive delivery services from a wireless device. The Educational Broadband Service (EBS), formerly known as the Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS), is an educational service that has generally been used for the transmission of instructional material to accredited educational institutions and non-educational institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes, training centers, and rehabilitation centers using high-powered systems. Our recent revamping of the EBS spectrum will now make it possible for EBS users to continue their instructional services utilizing low-power broadband systems while also providing students with high-speed internet access."," imagery, infrastructure, location, map,Geospatial","Under Secretary / Management","024:10","024:003","Open Data (MGMT)","edmo@hq.dhs.gov","2520","public","United States, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa","-","https://hifld-dhs-gii.opendata.arcgis.com/","05/19/2016","http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/"

"Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) Stations","As part of the U.S. National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP), the Deep Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART(R)) Project is an ongoing effort to maintain and improve the capability for the early detection and real-time reporting of tsunamis in the open ocean. DART(R) stations have been sited in regions with a history of generating destructive tsunamis to ensure early detection of tsunamis and to acquire data critical to real-time forecasts. DART(R) systems consist of an anchored seafloor bottom pressure recorder (BPR) and a companion moored surface buoy for real-time communications. An acoustic link transmits data from the BPR on the seafloor to the surface buoy. The data are then relayed via an Iridium satellite link to ground stations, which demodulate the signals for immediate dissemination to NOAA's Tsunami Warning Centers, NDBC, and PMEL. The National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) serves as the archive center for this data and provides the historical data to users."," imagery, infrastructure, location, map,Geospatial","Under Secretary / Management","024:10","024:003","Open Data (MGMT)","edmo@hq.dhs.gov","2525","public","Various seafloor locations throughout Atlantic, Pacific & Indian Oceans","-","https://hifld-dhs-gii.opendata.arcgis.com/","05/19/2016","http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/"

"Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Insured Banks","The Summary of Deposits (SOD) is the annual survey of branch office deposits for all FDIC-insured institutions including insured U.S. branches of foreign banks. Data are as of June 30. Users can access these data by(1) single institution, (2) institutions within a geographic area, or (3) aggregated within a geographic area. SOD features include custom market share reports and downloads.Linkhttp://www2.fdic.gov/sod/Scope of the SurveysTo provide a means for measuring deposits in local banking markets, the surveys obtain deposit figures for each banking office of branch banking systems, and for each insured U.S. branch of a foreign bank. Deposit figures for unit banks (which do not have branch offices) were obtained from the June Reports of Condition. Deposit Reporting - Institutions should report their deposits in a manner consistent with their existing internal record-keeping practices, however, other methods that logically reflect the deposit gathering activity of the bank's branches may be used. It is recognized that certain classes of deposits and deposits of certain types of customers may be assigned to a single office. Please refer to the reporting instructions for more information (see above). Arrangement of Published DataBecause these publications are used as a source of market share information for individual banking markets, the figures for each geographical area only include deposits of offices located within that area. Several institutions have designated home offices that do not accept deposits; these have been included in the survey to provide a more complete listing of all offices. Additional points that should be noted1. With the exception noted above, ""banking office"" is defined to include all offices and facilities that actually hold deposits, and does not include loan production offices, computer centers, and other nondeposit installations, such as automated teller machines (ATMs). 2. Institutions are allowed to combine deposit data from two or more offices within the same county for the following office typesdrive-in offices, seasonal branches, and military facilities. Where centralized bookkeeping or other conditions make it impossible to report exact figures, estimates are required. 3. International Banking Facility (IBF) deposits are considered deposits in foreign offices and are not included in the Summary of Deposits Survey. 4. Offices and deposits are reported by the institution that owned the office as of the close of business on June 30. 5. The term ""offices"" includes both main offices and branches. An institution with four branches operates a total of five offices. 6. All reports submitted to the FDIC and the OTS have been validated and corrected to the extent possible. There may be rounding differences or minor reporting errors reflected in the tables. 7. Savings Institutions include all FDIC-Insured financial institutions that operate under federal or state thrift banking charters. Prior to August 9, 1989, all institutions insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) and all savings banks insured by the FDIC are included in any applicable chart."," imagery, infrastructure, location, map,Geospatial","Under Secretary / Management","024:10","024:003","Open Data (MGMT)","edmo@hq.dhs.gov","2567","public","Continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa & Misc.

"Gold Bullion Repositories","This dataset contains privately and publicly owned bullion repositories. The privately owned repositories are included because they are members of the Industry Council for Tangible Assets (ICTA) as listed by the ICTA website and therefore deal with gold bullion or are the administrative headquarters of the bullion repository. Public locations are included based on the value (in US dollars) of the bullion stored, according to the United States Department of Treasury. Federal Reserve entities other than the one included in this database are excluded because the monetary amount of gold bullion, if any, stored at each location could not be determined, and per the United States Department of Treasury, the collective amount of the bullion stored among the remaining 11 Federal Reserve Banks and among the 25 Federal Reserve Branches (if any) is valued at less than one million US dollars. There are entities within this dataset that are also included in the HSIP Gold Federal Reserve layer or the HSIP Gold US Mint and Bureau of Engraving layer as the entities are considered to be a bullion repository as well as a Federal Reserve or a US Mint. The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] attribute. The oldest record dates from 07/19/2006 and the newest record dates from 07/24/2006. Due to the sensitive nature of these entities, TGS did not make contact with most of the entities within the database. For those entities not contacted by TGS, their existence and locations were determined based upon publicly available information and research conducted between 6/1/2006 and 7/31/2006."," imagery, infrastructure, location, map,Geospatial","Under Secretary / Management","024:10","024:003","Open Data (MGMT)","edmo@hq.dhs.gov","2597","public","Continental United States","-","https://hifld-dhs-gii.opendata.arcgis.com/","05/19/2016","http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/"

Non-Defense Federal Government Equivalent agencies provide accounting and finance services for non-military government agencies. Internal Revenue Service Taxpayers Assistance Centers provided payment arrangements, account inquiries, adjustments, tax forms and preparation, and accepts payments. State Government Payment Centers provide payroll services for state government employees. Credit card clearinghouses participate in the transfer of funds for a credit card. And check clearinghouses participate in the transfer of funds for a check transaction. The basis of this dataset was information gathered from official internet websites for the agencies represented in this dataset, as well as other public domain and open source research. The name, address, phone number and geospatial location for 90% of the entities were completely verified by TGS. The locations for the balance of the entities were assigned using automated methods. Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. All diacritics (e.g. the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics.

Hazmat routes in the NTAD, are organized into 3 database files, hazmat.shp, hmroutes.dbf, and hmstcnty.dbf. Each record in each database represents a unique Tiger/Line segment. These Tiger/Line segments are grouped into routes identified as character strings in the ROUTE_ID field in the hmroutes.dbf table. The route name appearing in the ROUTE_ID is assigned by FMCSA and is unique for each State [this sentence could be deleted - it doesn't add a lot to it]. The hmstcnty.dbf table allows the user to select routes by State and County.

The first file includes information on the tsunami source such as the date, time, and location of the source event; cause and validity of the source, tsunami magnitude and intensity; maximum water height; the total number of fatalities, injuries, houses destroyed, and houses damaged; and total damage estimate (in U.S. dollars). The second related file contains information on the runups (the locations where tsunami waves were observed by eyewitnesses, reconnaissance surveys, tide gauges, and deep-ocean sensors) such as name, location, arrival time, maximum water height and inundation distance, and socio-economic data (deaths, injuries, damage) for the specific runup location."," imagery, infrastructure, location, map,Geospatial","Under Secretary / Management","024:10","024:003","Open Data (MGMT)","edmo@hq.dhs.gov","2609","public","Global, to include virtually all coastal portions of HSIP extended AOI (North America, United States territories, Caribbean, etc.)","-","https://hifld-dhs-gii.opendata.arcgis.com/","05/19/2016","http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/"

The dataset only includes hospital facilities and does not include nursing homes. Data for all the states was acquired from respective states departments or their open source websites and then geocoded and converted into a spatial database. After geocoding the exact spatial location of each point was moved to rooftops wherever possible and points which have been physically verified have been labelled ""Geocode"", ""Imagery"", ""Imagery with other"" and ""Unverified"" depending on the methodology used to move the points. ""Unverified"" data points have still not been physically examined even though each of the points has been street geocoded as mentioned above. Missing records are denoted by 'Not Available' or NULL values.

"Hurricane Evacuation Routes","Hurricane Evacuation Routes in the United States A hurricane evacuation route is a designated route used to direct traffic inland in case of a hurricane threat. This dataset is based on supplied data from gulf coast and Atlantic seaboard states. Each state was contacted by TGS to determine an official source for hurricane evacuation routes. GIS data was gathered from states willing to share such data. In cases where states were unable or unwilling to share data in this format, TGS requested that the states provide a source for identifying hurricane evacuation routes. The states usually identified a website that made this data available to the public. Three (3) states (ME, NY, and NH) indicated that they do not maintain public maps showing hurricane evacuation routes and were unable or unwilling to share GIS files depicting such routes. Hurricane evacuation routes depicted on non-GIS maps were digitized using aerial ortho imagery while referencing supplied maps. Shape files that depicted hurricane evacuation routes were edge matched and merged with the digitized evacuation routes. All routes identified as primary hurricane evacuation routes were included in this dataset. If a state also designated secondary hurricane evacuation routes, they were included as well. Routes depicted in this dataset are dependent upon what each state identified as a hurricane evacuation route. Criteria used to identify these routes may vary from state to state."," imagery, infrastructure, location, map,Geospatial","Under Secretary / Management","024:10","024:003","Open Data (MGMT)","edmo@hq.dhs.gov","2612","public","Gulf & Atlantic Coastal United States","-","https://hifld-dhs-gii.opendata.arcgis.com/","05/19/2016","http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/"
"Hydraulic Structures","This table is required whenever hydraulic structures are shown in the flood profile. It is also required if levees are shown on the FIRM, channels containing the flooding are shown on the FIRM, or any other structure that impacts the area�s flood risk is shown on the FIRM. The S_Gen_Struct table contains information about the hydraulic structures within the study area. It should include all structures shown in the flood profiles. In addition, levees, sea walls, channels that contain flooding, and other significant flood control structures shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) should be included. A spatial file with locational information also corresponds with this data table. Spatial elements representing general structures are represented by lines. The lines should represent the primary characteristic of the structure. For example, bridges should be represented by the transportation centerline carried by the bridge. Dams should be represented by a line corresponding to the top of the dam. Levees should be represented by a line corresponding to the top of levee. A line corresponding to the centerline of the main barrel should represent a culvert. This is a Standard DFIRM Database table.

"Indian Reservations","The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian (AIANNH) Areas Shapefile includes the following legal entitiesfederally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust land areas, state-recognized American Indian reservations, and Hawaiian home lands (HHLs). The statistical entities included are Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs), tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs), and state designated tribal statistical areas (SDTSAs). Joint use areas are also included in this shapefile refer to areas that are administered jointly and/or claimed by two or more American Indian tribes. The Census Bureau designates both legal and statistical joint use areas as unique geographic entities for the purpose of presenting statistical data. Note that tribal subdivisions and Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) are additional types of American Indian/Alaska Native areas stored by the Census Bureau, but are displayed in separate shapefiles because of how they fall within the Census Bureau's geographic hierarchy. The State of Hawaii's Office of Hawaiian Home Lands provides the legal boundaries for the HHLs. The boundaries for ANVSAs, OTSAs, and TDSAs were delineated for the 2010 Census through the Tribal Statistical Areas Program (TSAP) by participants from the federally recognized tribal governments. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) within the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) provides the list of federally recognized tribes and only provides legal boundary information when the tribes need supporting records, if a boundary is based on treaty or another document that is historical or open to legal interpretation, or when another tribal, state, or local government challenges the depiction of a reservation or off-reservation trust land. The boundaries for federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands are as of January 1, 2013, as reported by the federally recognized tribal governments through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). The boundaries for state-recognized American Indian reservations and for SDTSAs were delineated by a state governor-appointed liaisons for the 2010 Census through the State American Indian Reservation Program and TSAP respectively."," imagery, infrastructure, location, map,Geospatial","Under Secretary / Management","024:10","024:003","Open Data (MGMT)","edmo@hq.dhs.gov","2615","public","Continental United States, Alaska & Hawaii","-","https://hifld-dhs-gii.opendata.arcgis.com/","05/19/2016","http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/"

"Mines and Mineral Resources","
Mines in the United States

According to the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program Tiger Team Report Table E-2.V.1 Sub-Layer Geographic Names, a mine is defined as a ""place or area from which commercial minerals are or were removed from the Earth; not including oilfield (pit, quarry, shaft)"". This dataset excludes sand and gravel quarries. Only mines believed to be operational are included.

The intention of TGS is to include only those entities that meet the above definition. TGS was not able to contact all of the entities in this layer to verify that they met this definition, therefore some entities may be included in this layer that do not meet the definition.

If a mine is closely associated with a manufacturing plant, it was linked to the TGS Industrial PinPointer dataset via a common identifier. For a mine to be ""closely associated"" with a manufacturing plant one or both of the following must be true""
>     1) The mine supplies a large part of a critical raw material for the manufacturing plant.
>     2) The manufacturing plant consumes a large part of the output of the mine.
>
>
The mine and the manufacturing plant need not be located in close proximity to each other to be ""closely associated"". Also, it is possible for more than one mine to be associated with a particular manufacturing plant, and for more than one manufacturing plant to be associated with a particular mine.

A mine associated with a manufacturing plant represents an potential additional point of vulnerability to the manufacturing plant, likewise, the manufacturing plant represents a potential additional point of vulnerability to the mine. Any relevant transportation links between the two represents a third potential vulnerability.

The links between the mines and the manufacturing plants are contained in the Mines_linked_to_ManufacturingID_table.dbf table. The [MINEID] field corresponds to the [SRCLNKID] attribute in this dataset. The [MNFID] corresponds to the [SRCLNKID] in the manufacturing dataset.

Mines are typically large facilities. To enable a first responder or law enforcement team to easily drive to the mine the point representing the mine has been placed at the place where the main ""haul road"" meets the nearest public road. This location may be a considerable distance from the mine pit or shaft, but from this point on the ground it should be obvious how to drive to the mine itself.
Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. 

All diacritics (e.g. the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics.

The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] attribute. Based upon this attribute the oldest record dates from 06/06/2006 and the newest record dates from 10/12/2006.

The NHD supersedes DLG and RF3 by incorporating them, not by replacing them. Users of DLG and RF3 will find the National Hydrography Dataset both familiar and greatly expanded and refined. The NHD provides a national framework for assigning reach addresses to water-related entities such as industrial dischargers, drinking water supplies, fish habitat areas, wild and scenic rivers. Reach addresses establish the locations of these entities relative to one another within the NHD surface water drainage network in a manner similar to street addresses. Once linked to the NHD by their reach addresses, the upstream/downstream relationships of these water-related entities and any associated information about them can be analyzed using software tools ranging from spreadsheets to Geographic Information Systems (GIS). GIS can also be used to combine NHD-based network analysis with other data layers, such as soils, land use, and population, to help better understand and display their respective effects upon one another. Furthermore, because the NHD provides a nationally consistent framework for addresses and analysis, water-related information linked to reach addresses by one organization (national, state, local) can be shared with other organizations and easily integrated into many different types of applications to the benefit of all. The National Hydrography Dataset is designed to provide comprehensive coverage of hydrologic data for the US. While initially based on 1:100,000-scale data, the NHD is designed to incorporate and encourage the development of higher-resolution data required by many users.

The NHD provides a national framework for assigning reach addresses to water-related entities such as industrial dischargers, drinking water supplies, fish habitat areas, wild and scenic rivers. Reach addresses establish the locations of these entities relative to one another within the NHD surface water drainage network in a manner similar to street addresses. Once linked to the NHD by their reach addresses, the upstream/downstream relationships of these water-related entities and any associated information about them can be analyzed using software tools ranging from spreadsheets to Geographic Information Systems (GIS). GIS can also be used to combine NHD-based network analysis with other data layers, such as soils, land use, and population, to help better understand and display their respective effects upon one another. Furthermore, because the NHD provides a nationally consistent framework for addresses and analysis, water-related information linked to reach addresses by one organization (national, state, local) can be shared with other organizations and easily integrated into many different types of applications to the benefit of all. The National Hydrography Dataset is designed to provide comprehensive coverage of hydrologic data for the US. While initially based on 1:100,000-scale data, the NHD is designed to incorporate and encourage the development of higher-resolution data required by many users. It will facilitate the improved integration of water-related data in support of the application requirements of a growing national user community and will enable shared maintenance and enhancement."," imagery, infrastructure, location, map,Geospatial","Under Secretary / Management","024:10","024:003","Open Data (MGMT)","edmo@hq.dhs.gov","2657","public","Continental United States & Hawaii","-","https://hifld-dhs-gii.opendata.arcgis.com/","05/19/2016","http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/"

"Political Boundaries (Area)","
A joint venture involving the National Atlas programs in Canada (Natural
Resources Canada), Mexico (Instituto Nacional de Estad�ica Geograf�e
Inform�ca), and the United States (U.S. Geological Survey), as well as
the North American Commission for Environmental Co-operation, has led to
the release (June 2004) of several new productsan updated paper map of
North America, and its associated geospatial data sets and their metadata.
These data sets are available online from each of the partner countries
both for download. This data has been revised and re-released in 2006.

The North American Atlas data are standardized geospatial data sets at
1:10,000,000 scale.  A variety of basic data layers (e.g. roads,
railroads, populated places, political boundaries, hydrography,
bathymetry, sea ice and glaciers) have been integrated so that their
relative positions are correct.  This collection of data sets forms a base
with which other North American thematic data may be integrated.  Any data
outside of Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America included in
the North American Atlas data sets is strictly to complete the context of
the data.

The North American Atlas - Political Boundaries data set shows political entities
in North America as polygons representing jurisdictional areas, and as lines
representing political boundaries, including International boundaries, Provincial
boundaries, State or territory boundaries, and the International Date Line.

This data set was produced using digital files supplied by Natural

"Political Boundaries (Line)","
A joint venture involving the National Atlas programs in Canada (Natural
Resources Canada), Mexico (Instituto Nacional de Estad�ica Geograf�e
Inform�ca), and the United States (U.S. Geological Survey), as well as
the North American Commission for Environmental Co-operation, has led to
the release (June 2004) of several new productsan updated paper map of
North America, and its associated geospatial data sets and their metadata.
These data sets are available online from each of the partner countries
both for download. This data has been revised and re-released in 2006.

The North American Atlas data are standardized geospatial data sets at
1:10,000,000 scale.  A variety of basic data layers (e.g. roads,
railroads, populated places, political boundaries, hydrography,
bathymetry, sea ice and glaciers) have been integrated so that their
relative positions are correct.  This collection of data sets forms a base
with which other North American thematic data may be integrated.  Any data
outside of Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America included in
the North American Atlas data sets is strictly to complete the context of
the data.

The North American Atlas - Political Boundaries data set shows political entities
in North America as polygons representing jurisdictional areas, and as lines
representing political boundaries, including International boundaries, Provincial
boundaries, State or territory boundaries, and the International Date Line.

This data set was produced using digital files supplied by Natural
Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estad�ica Geograf�e
Inform�ca, and the U.S. Geological Survey.

"Private Non-Retail Shipping Facilities","Private Non-Retail Shipping in the United States. The Private Non-Retail Shipping layer contains motor carrier freight terminals for some of largest trucking companies in the U.S. (as measured by revenue reported by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics). Entities from the following companies are included> United Parcel Service (UPS) > Yellow Freight System > Schneider > Roadway Express > FedEx > Con-Way Transportation > ABF Freight System > DHL > Corporate headquarters and other locations that do not actually handle freight are not included. No data could be obtained for Consolidated Freightways, Ryder Integrated Logistics, RPS and J.B. Hunt Transport Services. Facilities associated with these companies are not included in this dataset even though these companies have more annual revenue that some of the companies that are represented in this dataset. Many smaller, but still significant, companies have been excluded due to resource constraints. Examples include United Van Lines, Overnite Transportation, and American Freightways. Rail, air, sea, pipeline and inter-modal terminals are not included unless they are operated by one of the companies represented in this dataset. Facilities associated with the United States Postal Service (USPS) are not included. This dataset does not include retail shipping stores, drop boxes, and transportation operations that are not operated for hire. No entities located in American Samoa, The Northern Mariana Islands or the Virgin Islands are included in this dataset. The companies represented in this dataset are involved in the parcel delivery / courier service business or the freight service provider business. Parcel delivery / courier services deliver parcels, packages and other small shipments that typically weight less than 100 pounds according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. A freight service provider can include motor carriers, for-hire carriers and freight forwarders. According to the United Shippers Corporation, a motor carrier is defined as a company that provides truck transportation. A for-hire carrier is defined as a company that provides truck transportation of cargo belonging to others and is paid for doing so. A freight forwarder is defined as a company that arranges for truck transportation of cargo belonging to others, utilizing for-hire carriers to provide the actual truck transportation. The forwarder does assume the responsibility for the cargo from origin to destination and usually does take possession of the cargo at some point during the transportation. Forwarders typically assemble and consolidate less-than-truckload shipments into truckload shipments at origin and disassemble and deliver less-than-truckload shipments at destination. The intention of TGS is to include only those entities that meet the above definition. TGS was not able to contact all of the entities in this layer to verify that they met this definition, therefore some entities may be included in this layer that do not meet the definition. Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. All diacritics (e.g. the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics.

"Railroad Bridges","Bridges-Rail in the United States According to The National Bridge Inspection Standards published in the Code of Federal Regulations (23 CFR 650.3), a bridge isA structure including supports erected over a depression or an obstruction, such as water, highway, or railway, and having a track or passageway for carrying traffic or other moving loads. Each bridge was captured as a point which was placed in the center of the ""main span"" (highest and longest span). For bridges that cross navigable waterways, this was typically the part of the bridge over the navigation channel. If no ""main span"" was discernable using the imagery sources available, or if multiple non contiguous main spans were discernable, the point was placed in the center of the overall structure. Bridges that are sourced from the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) that cross state boundaries are an exception. Bridges that cross state boundaries are represented in the NBI by two records. The points for the two records have been located so as to be within the state indicated by the NBI's [STATE_CODE] attribute. In some cases, following these rules did not place the point at the location at which the bridge crosses what the user may judge as the most important feature intersected. For example, a given bridge may be many miles long, crossing nothing more than low lying ground for most of its length but crossing a major interstate at its far end. Due to the fact that bridges are often high narrow structures crossing depressions that may or may not be too narrow to be represented in the DEM used to orthorectify a given source of imagery, alignment with ortho imagery is highly variable. In particular, apparent bridge location in ortho imagery is highly dependent on collection angle. During verification, TechniGraphics used imagery from the following sourcesNGA HSIP 133 City, State or Local; NAIP; DOQQ imagery. In cases where ""bridge sway"" or ""tall structure lean"" was evident, TGS attempted to compensate for these factors when capturing the bridge location. For instances in which the bridge was not visible in imagery, it was captured using topographic maps at the intersection of the water and rail line. TGS processed 784 entities previously with the HSIP Bridges-Roads (STRAHNET Option - HSIP 133 Cities and Gulf Coast). These entities were added into this dataset after processing. No entities were included in this dataset for American Samoa, Guam, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands because there are no main line railways in these areas. At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. At the request of NGA, leading and trailing spaces were trimmed from all text fields. At the request of NGA, all diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is given by the publication date which is 09/02/2009. A more precise measure of currentness cannot be provided since this is dependent on the NBI and the source of imagery used during processing."," imagery, infrastructure, location, map,Geospatial","Under Secretary / Management","024:10","024:003","Open Data (MGMT)","edmo@hq.dhs.gov","2719","public","Continental United States, Alaska, Puerto Rico","-","https://hifld-dhs-gii.opendata.arcgis.com/","05/19/2016","http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/"
"Railroads","The Rail Lines layer represents the freight lines of the nation's railroad system. The data set covers all 50 states and the District of Colombia, as well as territories and possessions of the United States. No raillines exist in American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands of the US. This is a completed deliverable and is now in maintenance. Rail lines classified as abandoned, removed or trails on former rights-of-way may not be realigned. For this release, two rail status types have been removed from the databaseAbandoned (STATUS = A), Removed (STATUS = R). Abandoned lines are those lines that have been officially designated by the Surface Transportation Board as withdrawn from service. Railroads continue to own the rights of way, but may elect to remove rail track, ties and ballast. Removed lines are those that have had the physical track removed with only the right of way remaining. In some instances, the right of way is no long owned by a railroad and is only a historical reference. Trails (STATUS = T) are lines that have had track removed and the rights of way converted to trails for public use. For trails, ownership has been set to 'XXXX', and the LINKID, FROMNODE and TONODE set to 0. Passenger-only lines (STATUS = Z) have also had LINKID, FROMNODE and TONODE set to 0.

"Road and Railroad Tunnels","Tunnels in the United States According to the HSIP Tiger Team Report, a tunnel is defined as a linear underground passageway open at both ends. This dataset is based on the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Bridge Inventory (NBI). Records in the NBI that are attributed as ""Tunnels"" were extracted by TGS and were located using a combination of ortho imagery, topographic DRGs, NAVTEQ streets, and NAVTEQ railroads. Two points were captured for each tunnel, one at each tunnel opening. A line was then created either by tracing the NAVTEQ street / railroad, or, if there was not a NAVTEQ street / railroad coincident with the tunnel, then by a straight line joining the two points. For some tunnels, the NBI contains two records, one for the road through the tunnel and one for the road on top of the tunnel (if any). In these cases, both have been captured in this dataset. Features in this dataset that are over tunnels have a [RECTYPE] of ""1"", while features that are in tunnels have a [RECTYPE] of ""2"". Presumably, this was done because both roads could be blocked if the tunnel was destroyed. In some cases, the NBI only represented a tunnel with a record of type = ""1"" (over). In these cases, the following rules were applied1) If there was no road running through the tunnel, the road on top of the tunnel was captured. For example, if a mine conveyor runs through the tunnel and a county highway runs on top of the tunnel, the county highway was captured. 2) If a road ran through the tunnel, then this road was captured and the [RECTYPE] was changed to ""2"". The ""feature carried"" and ""feature intersected"" fields were also changed to be consistent with the feature actually captured.

Traffic lanes define specific traffic flow, while traffic separation zones assist opposing streams of marine traffic. Precautionary areas represent areas where ships must navigate with caution, and shipping safety fairways designate where artificial structures are prohibited. Recommended Routes are predetermined routes for shipping adopted for reasons of safety. Along certain zones of the East Coast of the United States, ships are also required to report vessel location within designated endangered species areas, such as the North Atlantic right whale. Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas need special protection because of their vulnerability to damage by international maritime activities. Areas to be Avoided are within defined limits where navigation is particularly hazardous or it is exceptionally important to avoid casualties and should be avoided by all ships or certain classes of ships."," imagery, infrastructure, location, map,Geospatial","Under Secretary / Management","024:10","024:003","Open Data (MGMT)","edmo@hq.dhs.gov","2704","public","Continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii & Caribbean region off Cuba","-","https://hifld-dhs-gii.opendata.arcgis.com/","05/19/2016","http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/"

"U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Maritime Differential GPS (DGPS) Locations","NAVCEN operates the Coast Guard Maritime Differential GPS (DGPS) Service and the developing Nationwide DGPS Service (NDGPS), consisting of two control centers and 86 remote broadcast sites. The Service broadcasts correction signals on marine radiobeacon frequencies to improve the accuracy and integrity to GPS-derived positions. The Coast Guard DGPS Service provides 10-meter accuracy in all established coverage areas. Typically, the position error of a DGPS position is 1 to 3 meters, greatly enhancing harbor entrance and approach navigation. The System provides service for coastal coverage of the continental U.S., the Great Lakes, Puerto Rico, portions of Alaska, Hawaii, and a large part of the Mississippi River Basin. Many foreign nations are implementing standard DGPS services modeled after the U.S. Coast Guard?s system to improve maritime safety in their critical waterways. The Coast Guard's maritime Differential Global Positioning Service achieved Full Operational Capability (FOC) on 15 March 1999 as announced in the DOT press release. The maritime DGPS service provides 10 meter (2 dRMS) navigation accuracy, integrity alarms for GPS and DGPS out-of-tolerance conditions within 10 seconds of detection, availability of 99.7% per month, coastal coverage to the continental United States, the Great Lakes, Puerto Rico/US Virgin Islands, and selected portions of Alaska and Hawaii. The achievement of FOC culminates a six-year effort to convert existing radiobeacon sites and construct new sites to transmit DGPS corrections. Several equipment upgrades were installed to improve system performance. During the procurement and installation phases of the system upgrades, the maritime DGPS service operated under Initial Operational Capability rules, where the signals provided accurate corrections with integrity to the maximum extent possible."," imagery, infrastructure, location, map,Geospatial","Under Secretary / Management","024:10","024:003","Open Data (MGMT)","edmo@hq.dhs.gov","2760","public","Continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii & Puerto Rico","-","https://hifld-dhs-gii.opendata.arcgis.com/","05/19/2016","http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/"

"U.S. County Boundaries","The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties. In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentationMunicipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities. The boundaries for counties and equivalent entities are mostly as of January 1, 2013, primarily as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). However, some changes made after January 2013, including the addition and deletion of counties, are included."," imagery, infrastructure, location, map,Geospatial","Under Secretary / Management","024:10","024:003","Open Data (MGMT)","edmo@hq.dhs.gov","2762","public","American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, United States, Puerto Rico, & U.S Virgin Islands","-","https://hifld-dhs-gii.opendata.arcgis.com/","05/19/2016","http://www.usa.gov/publicdomain/label/1.0/"

The attributes for these databases have been intentionally limited to location referencing attributes since the core station description attribute data are contained within the Station Description Tables (SDT). There is a separate Station Description Table (SDT) for each of the different station types; WIM, and ATR. The attributes in the Station Description Table correspond with the Station Description Record found in Chapter 6 of the latest Traffic Monitoring Guide. The SDT contains the most recent stations available for each state and station type. This table was derived from files provided UTCTR by FHWA. The Station Description Table can be linked to the station shapefile via the STNNKEY field . A single exception table containing records for those stations that could not be located is provided for WIM, and ATR stations. Generally, this table contains records where location descriptions were not clear enough to locate a station.

"Wrecks and Obstructions","In 1981, NOAA�s National Ocean Service (NOS) implemented the Automated Wreck and Obstruction Information System (AWOIS) to assist in planning hydrographic survey operations and to catalog and store a substantial volume of reported wrecks and obstructions that are considered navigational hazards within U.S. coastal waters. As part of the hydrographic survey planning process, these records are reviewed and those records which require additional field investigation are assigned to specific field units for verification. The results of these investigations eventually become part of the AWOIS record so that a permanent history of a wreck or obstruction is always available. AWOIS is not a comprehensive record of wrecks in any particular area. There are wrecks in AWOIS that do not appear on the nautical chart and there are wrecks on the nautical chart that do not appear in AWOIS. Updates to AWOIS are ongoing; however, it will never completely address every known or reported wreck.
